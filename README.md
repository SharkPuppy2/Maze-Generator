# Maze - Generator and Solver
Typically, the backtracking algorithm is used to solve a maze, i.e., it finds the optimal path from start to finish. In this project we apply backtracking slightly differntly - to create the maze. 

This C++ application creates and solves the maze in runtime. It also allows the user to participate in the game! The game is run in the console itself.
